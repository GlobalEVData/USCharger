## [Decadal Evolution of Public EV Charger System in the U.S. (2014-2024)](./A.md)
> U.S. public EV charger system has expanded more than tenfold over the past decade, with AC L2/DC fast chargers replacing obsolete AC L1. By the end of 2024, U.S. public EV charging coverage reached 75.6% of counties (from 34% in 2014). The spatial patterns of public EV chargers transitioned from fragmented coastal clusters (2014) to polycentric national networks by 2024, with emerging inland hubs and strengthened coastal nodes.
